#LoaderList

Creates a .txt of a custom name in the world folder. Logs all activity of chunk loading and unloading (except players).

Originally created by [Tombenpotter](https://github.com/Tombenpotter/) for debug use in [Sanguimancy](https://github.com/Tombenpotter/Sanguimancy).

I was given permission to move it from there into it's own separate mod.
